# Neurobiology and Centiles in Psychosis

This repository contains code and data created in support of the project García-San-Martín, N.; Bethlehem, R. AI; Mihalik, A. et al. *"Molecular and micro-architectural mapping of gray matter alterations in psychosis"* Mol. Psychiatry (2024). All code was written in Matlab and R. Folders, files, and first steps are described below.

## **Data**

The `Data` folder contains all the data required for running the analyses. Here are the files that need to be downloaded and stored in a specific location. The remaining files will be automatically generated:

-	The code used to compute centiles (`BrainCharts` folder) is available at https://github.com/brainchart/Lifespan

-	The `all_microsc_DesikanKilliany68.csv` file is available at https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools

-	The code used for the PCA-CCA analyses (`cca_pls_toolkit_dev-grcca` folder) is available at https://github.com/anaston/cca_pls_toolkit

## **First steps**

1.	Download `Code` folder, which contains the scripts and functions used for the analyses.

2.	Download `Data` folder, which contains data used to run the analyses, and will include data derived from them.

3.	Create `Centiles` and `Effect sizes` folders in `Data`. `Centiles` must contain 4 subfolders: `PE`, `FEP`, `SCZ_SAD`, and `groups`. 
-	`PE` folder will contain data corresponding to Psychotic Experiences. Please store `BrainCharts` folder in it along with your .csv file containing volume data from these patients.

-	`FEP` folder will contain data corresponding to First Episode of Psychosis. Please store in it your .csv file containing volume data from these patients.

-	`SCZ_SAD` folder will contain data corresponding to relatives and chronic SCZ and SAD individuals. Please store in it your .csv file containing volume data from these patients.

-	`groups` folder will contain data from patients classified under different groups according to their clinical profile. Please store in it your .csv file containing volume data from these patients.


4.	Please store `all_microsc_DesikanKilliany68.csv` file and `cca_pls_toolkit_dev-grcca` folder in `PCA_CCA` folder.


## **Code**

The `Code` folder contains all the code required for running the analyses and generate the figures. All scripts are designed to be sequentially executed. Don't forget to change the location variable regularly. 

-	[NCP_01_means_PARC_aparc_volume.R](Code/NCP_01_means_PARC_aparc_volume.R) – calculates the average of the different brain volume regions between both hemispheres, left and right. It takes a .csv file with volume data from both hemispheres as input, and returns a `mean_volumes.csv` file.

-	[NCP_02_centile_estimation.R](Code/NCP_02_centile_estimation.R) – calculates the centiles of brain volume regions from the `mean_volumes.csv` file. It returns a `centiles.csv` file.

-	[NCP_03_centile_PE.m](Code/NCP_03_centile_PE.m) – classifies centiles by PE diagnosis (suspected, definite, or clinical). It storages the results in (1) a `PE.mat` variable that will be used for the rest of analyses, (2) `mean_PE-suspected.csv`, `mean_PE-definite.csv`, and `mean_PE-clinical.csv` files that will be used for regional brain mapping (NCP_13_centile_mapping.R).

-	[NCP_04_centile_SCZ_SAD.m](Code/NCP_04_centile_SCZ_SAD.m) – classifies centiles by SCZ or SAD diagnosis, or by relatives of SCZ or SAD patients (SCZ, SAD, SCZ-relatives, or SAD-relatives, respectively). It storages the results in (1) `SCZ.mat` and `Schizoaffective_Disorder.mat` variables that will be used for the rest of analyses, (2) `mean_SCZ.csv`, `mean_SAD.csv`, `mean_SAD-relatives.csv`, and `mean_SCZ-relatives.csv` that will be used for regional brain mapping (NCP_13_centile_mapping.R).

-	[NCP_05_centile_FEP.m](Code/NCP_05_centile_FEP.m) – selects centiles from the first session of a First Episode of Psychosis. It storages the results in (1) a `FEP.mat` variable that will be used for the rest of analyses, (2) a `mean_FEP.csv` file that will be used for regional brain mapping (NCP_13_centile_mapping.R).

-	[NCP_06_centile_and_effect_sizes_groups.m](Code/NCP_06_centile_and_effect_sizes_groups.m) – classifies centiles by groups according to their clinical profile: SCZ and SAD-relatives, PE, FEP or SCZ and SAD-chronic. It storages the results in (1) a `G0.mat`, `G1.mat`, `G1_5.mat`, and `G2.mat` variables, respectively, that will be used for the rest of analyses, (2) a `mean_SCZ_and_SAD-relatives.csv`, `mean_PE.csv`, `mean_FEP.csv`, and `mean_SCZ_and_SAD-chronic.csv` files that will be used for regional brain mapping (NCP_13_centile_mapping.R). Additionally, it computes the effect sizes between groups and saves the corresponding results in `Data` > `Effect sizes`.

-	[NCP_07_region_permutation_test.m](Code/NCP_07_region_permutation_test.m) – it tests the regions that exhibit significant centile differences from healthy controls (Wilcoxon rank sum test), or that the effect sizes are significantly different from 0 (permutation test) with FDR correction. It takes as input all the .mat variables previously generated, and returns a `significant_values.csv` file that will be used for regional brain mapping (NCP_13_centile_mapping.R).

-	[NCP_08_SSD.m](Code/NCP_08_SSD.m) – calculates the Sum of Squared Diferences (SSD) between diagnoses and groups (relatives, PE, FEP and chronic). It takes as input all the .mat variables previously generated, and displays two figures representing the SSD between diagnoses, and between groups.

-	[NCP_09_parfor_groups_CCA.m](Code/NCP_09_parfor_groups_CCA.m) – runs in parallel multiple PCA-CCA of psychosis-related groups classified according to their clinical profile. See [NCP_10_CCA_cent_var.m](Code/NCP_10_CCA_cent_var.m) and [NCP_11_run_CCA.m](Code/NCP_11_run_CCA.m) scripts before execution.
